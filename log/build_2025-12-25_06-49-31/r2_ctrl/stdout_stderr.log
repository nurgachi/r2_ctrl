[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrobomas_package_2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "robomas_package_2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robomas_package_2"
  with any of the following names:

    robomas_package_2Config.cmake
    robomas_package_2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robomas_package_2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "robomas_package_2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "robomas_package_2" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
